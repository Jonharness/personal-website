        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello, I am Levi Hesseling, going by the online moniker of Jonharness. I am a high-school student living in the North Island of New Zealand. I have recently rekindled my interest in coding due to a technological education course which I am taking. As such, I have once more dipped my toes into coding, particularly with Python and now HTML - though I hope to later branch out into C++.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>This website</h2>
        
        <p>This website is being developed as a personal project alongside an IT course I am doing just as a fun personal project. I don't expect this to be anything particularly fancy or nice, and I probably won't even develop it much at all, but it's there just for fun</p>
