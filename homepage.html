        <p>Hello, I am Levi Hesseling, going by the online moniker of Jonharness. I am a high-school student living in the North Island of New Zealand. I have recently rekindled my interest in coding due to a technological education course which I am taking. As such, I have once more dipped my toes into coding, particularly with Python and now HTML - though I hope to later branch out into C++.</p>
